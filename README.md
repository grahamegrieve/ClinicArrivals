## Developer Documentation

### Building

Requirements:
Visual Studio 2019 on Windows.

.NET Framework target: 4.6.2.

### Local Storage 

The application stores information locally in the $AppData$\Roaming\ClinicArrivals.

The current [settings](documentation/Settings.md) are stored there. 

In addition, the communication record of past appointments is also stored there. Deleting this information or moving the application to a different PC without moving this data will reset any ongoing messaging flows with the patients.

### Kernel

The core of the program is in `MessageEngine.cs`. This is where the application queries for the current appointment list from the PMS, and also scans for incoming SMS messages to process.

Periodically (as specified in the settings), the application searches for all appointments on the current day. Then it works through the appointments.


### Testing
