# Making a new ClinicArrivals release

Target audience: ClinicArrivals developers.

1. Create a release using the standard Github interface ([instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)). For the version, use [SemVer 1.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v1.0.0.html) (2.0.0 not supported).
2. Wait 2-3 mins for the [release publication](https://github.com/grahamegrieve/ClinicArrivals/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+release%22) workflow to run.
3. When the workflow is done, refresh the release page and verify that the new release zip is now attached.

The release is now ready to be published to the world.
