# ClinicArrivals Documentation
 
This program should help a General Practitioner (GP) manage increased workload during the [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) crisis in Australia. It is designed to fit into an existing clinic workflow using common Practice Management Systems (PMS).

The primary purposes of the application are to: 

* Keep Patients out of the waiting room where they are an infection risk to each other 
* Support the use of teleconsulation for patients who are an infection risk

The application uses SMS messages (due to their wide ubiquity) for patient communication,
and [OpenVidu](https://openvidu.org/) for the video consultations.
